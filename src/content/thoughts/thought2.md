Right now, my RSS feed publishes posts from my `/posts/` folder. Adding new thoughts in `src/content/thoughts/` will not create a new RSS item.

So, I will have to decide whether I even *want* these to go out via RSS. If so, I'll need to create a separate feed (or figure out how to combine the two). I suspect an RSS feed that distributes items from *multiple collections* would be easy enough to figure out, but I haven't yet converted my older, existing "posts" to a collection. I haven't yet thought about what it might look like (if even possible) to combine items from `/pages/posts/` and from a content collection. 

Alternatively, I could experiment with publishing these to Twitter, Mastodon or Bluesky.
