You have to be selective because you can't (at least, **I** can't) READ ALL THE THINGS. I realized today that refusing to click on links from Medium, LinkedIn, and probably other sites that I "know when I see them", helps to arbitrarily constrain my reading inbox.

Will I miss some great stuff? Absolutely! But I was going to anyway. Is it a silent, futile protest? I'm sure it is! But, it means that personal and indie sites will get my clicks because they win my attention.

Do you need a place of your own to write where you control your own content? It's easy to get started with an Astro site to blog, or a Starlight site to organize info like documentation, notes or any structured content. Visit [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build) to get started, and hop into the [Astro Discord](https://astro.build/chat) if you want to connect with a friendly, welcoming community of others doing the same thing!
