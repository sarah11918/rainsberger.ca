I have written before about my most awesome, practically spoiler-proof system on MacOS for reading Blue Jays tweets in "alternate time" as we watch PVR-delay or archived games (and a comparable Android version). But, it's not simply "set it and forget it!" When the Blue Jays sign a new player or I find a new Jays fan to follow on Twitter, new accounts need to be added to this system.

When I find a new Twitter user to follow that tweets about the Blue Jays at least semi-regularly, I have to assume that there may come a day when one of their tweets might spoil the result of a game we haven't watched yet.

But, of course I still want to *see* those tweets, otherwise, why would I be following that user? I just don't want to see them until I'm ready to see them. Muting hides a tweet from your view. But *filtering* distributes your tweets into different views!  

## My Process to update my system:


1. Follow the user on Twitter
2. Add the user to my "Blue Jays" Twitter List at the source via Twitter (website, or 3rd party app). (This is primarily for organization, and for use in the Android solution. All my filtering happens locally, in my Mac app.)
3. In Yoru Fukurou on Mac OS: Using "Add User to tab" - My tab settings are already set up so that adding users to my Blue Jays tab redirects tweets both from and mentioning this user *out* of my regular timeline and *into* my Jays filter tab for reading later

4. In Tweecha on Android: Using "Mute Settings - Definitions" - I do need to manually add the user to the list of muted users. Tweecha mutes locally at the app-level, not at the twitter-dot-com-account level, and lets you specify *where* (from which views) the user is muted, which is important. (Otherwise, you'd never see these tweets anywhere!) If it's an account others may be tweeting *about*, then I also add this user name (and/or their real name, in the case of baseball players) to the list of keywords/text to mute.     


(Remember, Tweecha allows selective muting, so you're not *completely* muting a user, just hiding their tweets from certain views. In my case, I mute these users from my Timeline but not when reading my Blue Jays Twitter List.)

![Specific mute settings, which control in which app views the mute rules apply: timeline, search results, mentions, lists, conversations, etc.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLWi9WPz9nnP4bU5-0U-fpQzxcEwqQz5-aPpeDoNE_PCNBK-ZlS6sKjzjTfpiSPfHCYWAyOjb8ccX8Whqfkzg5K0pcMlLoLFP7BwIr3BDZ5HLHwAHxN1KfcU-kgzmfN4hvmdBDXC4yj-5faglxe9l-cOcg=w250-no?.jpg)

After these few steps, I can read Twitter in two different "timelines" (occurring in two different "times") on either Mac OS or Android: real-time (or as caught up as I happen to be reading my normal twitter timeline) and a separate "Blue Jays time."

This "alternate Blue Jays time" could be a "#PVR Delay" (since we record every Jays game, even when we're home, and start watching on a delay so we can fast forward through the commercials). Or, it could be even a day or two behind if we're traveling and watching archived, completed games much later on MLB TV. This system maintains two separate timelines, in two different "current times" so that I don't simply miss tweets (ie muted and never seen) that might spoil a Blue Jays game.
