My Android apps of choice, many of which are cross-platform services.

## NoteTaking

* [Simplenote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.automattic.simplenote) (text)
* [Squid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.steadfastinnovation.android.projectpapyrus) (handwritten)
* [S-Note](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.snote) (quick memos)

## Weather

* [Weather Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.stephanson.YRWidgetHD) - You have to see it to believe it. This is the first thing I put on a new phone.
* [Windy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.windyty.android) - To be honest, I find the app is a little much for what I need, but it has great widgets.
* [Weawow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weawow) - Again, I don't personally use the app itself much, but nice widgets and you can set the widgets to report "feels like" temps (wind chill/humidex) which I prefer. (Why yes, I do have SIX different weather widgets spanning two of my home screens.)


## Twitter, News, RSS

* [Twitpane](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitpane) - I can't live with out this. How do you Twitter without this app?
* [Tweecha](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sinproject.android.tweecha) - I love it *almost* as much as Twitpane. When I'm reading Blue Jays baseball Twitter on delay, this is the app I use to keep "current" in my "alternate timeline."  
* [Gravity](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.mobileways.gravity) (Yes, the old Nokia Twitter app on Android! Nostalgia!)
* [Slide for Reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.ccrama.redditslide) - Don't forget to set up Synccit to sync between devices and with the website. ("Old Reddit" website only, though.)
* [Flym News Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.frju.flym) - A simple, but elegant RSS feed reader. My fave to use, but does not synchronize with any online feed reader.
* [Feed Me RSS/Podcast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seazon.feedme) - The closest thing to Flym that syncs (I use Old Reader, but it works with several options.)

## Coordinating/Planning/Organizing

* [Todoist](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todoist)
* [Listonic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.l) (shared/synced shopping lists)
* [Pocket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro) (read later/archive)
* [Sync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sync.mobileapp) (Canadian cloud storage, shared folders)
* [Google Sheets](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.sheets) (shared data)

* [Piktures](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diune.pictures) - Another beautiful gallery app, if you don't want something like F-Stop.
* [pFolio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapwood.photos2) (for Google Photos; dev has other apps for other services like Flikr etc.)
* [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed) - The photo editor I keep coming back to for tweaks, especially easy to use selective and brush edits (i.e. lightening up just a bird's face)
* [Polarr Photo Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=photo.editor.polarr) - One of the few RAW photo editors for Android, and good denoise tools. I'll often put photos through this before making some adjustments in Snapseed.
* [Photo Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iudesk.android.photo.editor) - Powerful, full-featured, no-nonsense editor for photo edits as well as adding text etc.

* [Dragon Academy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamchaos.dragonacademy) - This *was* my Candy Crush until I eventually finished it. Old and hasn't been updated in years, but maybe it still works on new devices?

## VPN
